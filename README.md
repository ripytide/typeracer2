# typeracer2
## What is it?
Typeracer2 is a fullstack multiplayer typeracing website.
## Inspiration
I love typeracing but I don't like the mechanics of typeracer.com. I love the mechanics of monkeytype but its only single-player at the moment as far as I know.

Hence, I decided to make a multiplayer typeracer mirroring the mechanics of monkeytype and I few other upgrades such as more real-time opponent updates compared to
typeracer.com.

I also wanted to do the project to improve my skills with some web frameworks, learn github actions/auto-deployment, and especially to learn the test-driven-development approach using unit testing.

## Tech stack
Made with react(cra), socket.io, tailwindcss, jest and react-testing-library.

Deployed using github actions.
